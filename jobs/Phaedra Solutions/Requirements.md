### 1. Core Concepts

Focus on the core requirements listed in the description. Here's a breakdown of areas to prepare:

#### Frontend Development

-   React/Angular/Vue: Review the basics of components, state management, and hooks (if React).
    Focus on building functional UI components from wireframes.
-   HTML/CSS: Brush up on semantic HTML, modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, transitions), and responsive design principles (media queries).
-   Cross-Browser Compatibility: Know tools like BrowserStack to test and fix browser-specific issues.
-   Optimization: Learn techniques like minification, lazy loading, and reducing DOM manipulations.

#### Backend Development

-   Node.js: Understand building RESTful APIs, middleware, and error handling in Express.js.
-   Database: Be familiar with CRUD operations in MongoDB. Understand NoSQL vs SQL differences.

#### Testing

-   Review unit testing tools like Jest or Mocha and integration tests for API endpoints.

#### General Skills

-   Wireframes to Web App: Practice implementing basic wireframes into fully functional web pages.
-   Performance: Study how to optimize client-side rendering and minimize network requests.

### 2. Coding Challenges

Solve coding problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank related to:

-   Array and string manipulation.
-   Asynchronous programming (Promises, Async/Await).
-   Design patterns (MVC, Singleton).

---

### 3. Portfolio

Prepare a strong portfolio showcasing:

-   Interactive UIs built with React/Angular/Vue.
